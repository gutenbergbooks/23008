      THE SHERIFF AND HIS PARTNER.
    </h1>
    <p>
      <b> By Frank Harris </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon in July, 1869, I was seated at my desk in Locock&rsquo;s
      law-office in the town of Kiota, Kansas. I had landed in New York from
      Liverpool nearly a year before, and had drifted westwards seeking in vain
      for some steady employment. Lawyer Locock, however, had promised to let me
      study law with him, and to give me a few dollars a month besides, for my
      services as a clerk. I was fairly satisfied with the prospect, and the
      little town interested me. An outpost of civilization, it was situated on
      the border of the great plains, which were still looked upon as the
      natural possession of the nomadic Indian tribes. It owed its importance to
      the fact that it lay on the cattle-trail which led from the prairies of
      Texas through this no man&rsquo;s land to the railway system, and that it was
      the first place where the cowboys coming north could find a bed to sleep
      in, a bar to drink at, and a table to gamble on. For some years they had
      made of Kiota a hell upon earth. But gradually the land in the
      neighbourhood was taken up by farmers, emigrants chiefly from New England,
      who were determined to put an end to the reign of violence. A man named
      Johnson was their leader in establishing order and tranquillity. Elected,
      almost as soon as he came to the town, to the dangerous post of City
      Marshal, he organized a vigilance committee of the younger and more daring
      settlers, backed by whom he resolutely suppressed the drunken rioting of
      the cowboys. After the ruffians had been taught to behave themselves,
      Johnson was made Sheriff of the County, a post which gave him a house and
      permanent position. Though married now, and apparently &ldquo;settled down,&rdquo; the
      Sheriff was a sort of hero in Kiota. I had listened to many tales about
      him, showing desperate determination veined with a sense of humour, and I
      often regretted that I had reached the place too late to see him in
      action. I had little or nothing to do in the office. The tedium of the
      long days was almost unbroken, and Stephen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Commentaries&rdquo; had become as
      monotonous and unattractive as the bare uncarpeted floor. The heat was
      tropical, and I was dozing when a knock startled me. A negro boy slouched
      in with a bundle of newspapers: &ldquo;This yer is Jedge Locock&rsquo;s, I guess?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
      guess so,&rdquo; was my answer as I lazily opened the third or fourth number of
      the &ldquo;Kiota Weekly Tribune.&rdquo; Glancing over the sheet my eye caught the
      following paragraph:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;HIGHWAY ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE.

     JUDGE SHANNON STOPPED.

     THE OUTLAW ESCAPES. HE KNOWS SHERIFF JOHNSON.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Information has just reached us of an outrage perpetrated on the person
      of one of our most respected fellow-citizens. The crime was committed in
      daylight, on the public highway within four miles of this city; a crime,
      therefore, without parallel in this vicinity for the last two years.
      Fortunately our County and State authorities can be fully trusted, and we
      have no sort of doubt that they can command, if necessary, the succour and
      aid of each and every citizen of this locality in order to bring the
      offending miscreant to justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We now place the plain recital of this outrage before our readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday afternoon, as Ex-Judge Shannon was riding from his law-office
      in Kiota towards his home on Sumach Bluff, he was stopped about four miles
      from this town by a man who drew a revolver on him, telling him at the
      same time to pull up. The Judge, being completely unarmed and unprepared,
      obeyed, and was told to get down from the buckboard, which he did. He was
      then ordered to put his watch and whatever money he had, in the road, and
      to retreat three paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The robber pocketed the watch and money, and told him he might tell
      Sheriff Johnson that Tom Williams had &lsquo;gone through him,&rsquo; and that he
      (Williams) could be found at the saloon in Osawotamie at any time. The
      Judge now hoped for release, but Tom Williams (if that be the robber&rsquo;s
      real name) seemed to get an afterthought, which he at once proceeded to
      carry into effect. Drawing a knife he cut the traces, and took out of the
      shafts the Judge&rsquo;s famous trotting mare, Lizzie D., which he mounted with
      the remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sheriff Johnson, I reckon, would come after the money anyway, but the
      hoss&rsquo;ll fetch him&mdash;sure pop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These words have just been given to us by Judge Shannon himself, who
      tells us also that the outrage took place on the North Section Line,
      bounding Bray&rsquo;s farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this speech the highway robber Williams rode towards the township
      of Osawotamie, while Judge Shannon, after drawing the buckboard to the
      edge of the track, was compelled to proceed homewards on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The outrage, as we have said, took place late last evening, and Judge
      Shannon, we understand, did not trouble to inform the County authorities
      of the circumstance till to-day at noon, after leaving our office. What
      the motive of the crime may have been we do not worry ourselves to
      inquire; a crime, an outrage upon justice and order, has been committed;
      that is all we care to know. If anything fresh happens in this connection
      we propose to issue a second edition of this paper. Our fellow-citizens
      may rely upon our energy and watchfulness to keep them posted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just before going to press we learn that Sheriff Johnson was out of town
      attending to business when Judge Shannon called; but Sub-Sheriff Jarvis
      informs us that he expects the Sheriff back shortly. It is necessary to
      add, by way of explanation, that Mr. Jarvis cannot leave the jail
      unguarded, even for a few hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As may be imagined this item of news awakened my keenest interest. It
      fitted in with some things that I knew already, and I was curious to learn
      more. I felt that this was the first act in a drama. Vaguely I remembered
      some one telling in disconnected phrases why the Sheriff had left
      Missouri, and come to Kansas:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas after a quor&rsquo;ll with a pardner of his, named Williams, who kicked
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bit by bit the story, to which I had not given much attention when I heard
      it, so casually, carelessly was it told, recurred to my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say as how Williams cut up rough with Johnson, and drawed a knife on
      him, which Johnson gripped with his left while he pulled trigger.&mdash;Williams,
      I heerd, was in the wrong; I hain&rsquo;t perhaps got the right end of it;
      anyhow, you might hev noticed the Sheriff hes lost the little finger off
      his left hand.&mdash;Johnson, they say, got right up and lit out from
      Pleasant Hill. Perhaps the folk in Mizzoori kinder liked Williams the best
      of the two; I don&rsquo;t know. Anyway, Sheriff Johnson&rsquo;s a square man; his
      record here proves it. An&rsquo; real grit, you bet your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The narrative had made but a slight impression on me at the time; I didn&rsquo;t
      know the persons concerned, and had no reason to interest myself in their
      fortunes. In those early days, moreover, I was often homesick, and gave
      myself up readily to dreaming of English scenes and faces. Now the words
      and drawling intonation came back to me distinctly, and with them the
      question: Was the robber of Judge Shannon the same Williams who had once
      been the Sheriff&rsquo;s partner? My first impulse was to hurry into the street
      and try to find out; but it was the chief part of my duty to stay in the
      office till six o&rsquo;clock; besides, the Sheriff was &ldquo;out of town,&rdquo; and
      perhaps would not be back that day. The hours dragged to an end at last;
      my supper was soon finished, and, as night drew down, I hastened along the
      wooden side-walk of Washington Street towards the Carvell House. This
      hotel was much too large for the needs of the little town; it contained
      some fifty bedrooms, of which perhaps half-a-dozen were permanently
      occupied by &ldquo;high-toned&rdquo; citizens, and a billiard-room of gigantic size,
      in which stood nine tables, as well as the famous bar. The space between
      the bar, which ran across one end of the room, and the billiard-tables,
      was the favourite nightly resort of the prominent politicians and
      gamblers. There, if anywhere, my questions would be answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the billiard-room I was struck by the number of men who had
      come together. Usually only some twenty or thirty were present, half of
      whom sat smoking and chewing about the bar, while the rest watched a game
      of billiards or took a &ldquo;life&rdquo; in pool. This evening, however, the
      billiard-tables were covered with their slate-coloured &ldquo;wraps,&rdquo; while at
      least a hundred and fifty men were gathered about the open space of
      glaring light near the bar. I hurried up the room, but as I approached the
      crowd my steps grew slower, and I became half ashamed of my eager,
      obtrusive curiosity and excitement. There was a kind of reproof in the
      lazy, cool glance which one man after another cast upon me, as I went by.
      Assuming an air of indecision I threaded my way through the chairs
      uptilted against the sides of the billiard-tables. I had drained a glass
      of Bourbon whisky before I realized that these apparently careless men
      were stirred by some emotion which made them more cautious, more silent,
      more warily on their guard than usual. The gamblers and loafers, too, had
      taken &ldquo;back seats&rdquo; this evening, whilst hard-working men of the farmer
      class who did not frequent the expensive bar of the Carvell House were to
      be seen in front. It dawned upon me that the matter was serious, and was
      being taken seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken from time to time by some casual remark of no
      interest, drawled out in a monotone; every now and then a man invited the
      &ldquo;crowd&rdquo; to drink with him, and that was all. Yet the moral atmosphere was
      oppressive, and a vague feeling of discomfort grew upon me. These men
      &ldquo;meant business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently the door on my left opened&mdash;Sheriff Johnson came into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said; and a dozen voices, one after another, answered
      with &ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;! good evenin&rsquo;, Sheriff!&rdquo; A big frontiersman, however, a
      horse-dealer called Martin, who, I knew, had been on the old vigilance
      committee, walked from the centre of the group in front of the bar to the
      Sheriff, and held out his hand with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake, old man, and name the drink.&rdquo; The Sheriff took the proffered hand
      as if mechanically, and turned to the bar with &ldquo;Whisky&mdash;straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheriff Johnson was a man of medium height, sturdily built. A broad
      forehead, and clear, grey-blue eyes that met everything fairly, testified
      in his favour. The nose, however, was fleshy and snub. The mouth was not
      to be seen, nor its shape guessed at, so thickly did the brown moustache
      and beard grow; but the short beard seemed rather to exaggerate than
      conceal an extravagant out jutting of the lower jaw, that gave a peculiar
      expression of energy and determination to the face. His manner was
      unobtrusively quiet and deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an unusual occurrence for Johnson to come at night to the
      bar-lounge, which was beginning to fall into disrepute among the
      puritanical or middle-class section of the community. No one, however,
      seemed to pay any further attention to him, or to remark the unusual
      cordiality of Martin&rsquo;s greeting. A quarter of an hour elapsed before
      anything of note occurred. Then, an elderly man whom I did not know, a
      farmer, by his dress, drew a copy of the &ldquo;Kiota Tribune&rdquo; from his pocket,
      and, stretching it towards Johnson, asked with a very marked Yankee twang:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheriff, hev yeou read this &lsquo;Tribune&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wheeling half round towards his questioner, the Sheriff replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I hev.&rdquo; A pause ensued, which was made significant to me by the
      fact that the bar-keeper suspended his hand and did not pour out the
      whisky he had just been asked to supply&mdash;a pause during which the two
      faced each other; it was broken by the farmer saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ez yeou wer out of town to-day, I allowed yeou might hev missed seein&rsquo; 
      it. I reckoned yeou&rsquo;d come straight hyar before yeou went to hum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Crosskey,&rdquo; rejoined the Sheriff, with slow emphasis; &ldquo;I went home
      first and came on hyar to see the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; said Mr. Crosskey, as it seemed to me, half apologetically,
      &ldquo;knowin&rsquo; yeou I guessed yeou ought to hear the facks,&rdquo; then, with some
      suddenness, stretching out his hand, he added, &ldquo;I hev some way to go, an&rsquo; 
      my old woman &lsquo;ull be waitin&rsquo; up fer me. Good night, Sheriff.&rdquo; The hands
      met while the Sheriff nodded: &ldquo;Good night, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few greetings to right and left Mr. Crosskey left the bar. The
      crowd went on smoking, chewing, and drinking, but the sense of expectancy
      was still in the air, and the seriousness seemed, if anything, to have
      increased. Five or ten minutes may have passed when a man named Reid, who
      had run for the post of Sub-Sheriff the year before, and had failed to
      beat Johnson&rsquo;s nominee Jarvis, rose from his chair and asked abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheriff, do you reckon to take any of us uns with you to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an indefinable ring of sarcasm in his negligent tone, the Sheriff
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not, Mr. Reid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quickly Reid replied: &ldquo;Then I reckon there&rsquo;s no use in us stayin&rsquo;;&rdquo; and
      turning to a small knot of men among whom he had been sitting, he added,
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men got up and filed out after their leader without greeting the
      Sheriff in any way. With the departure of this group the shadow lifted.
      Those who still remained showed in manner a marked relief, and a moment or
      two later a man named Morris, whom I knew to be a gambler by profession,
      called out lightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The crowd and you&rsquo;ll drink with me, Sheriff, I hope? I want another
      glass, and then we won&rsquo;t keep you up any longer, for you ought to have a
      night&rsquo;s rest with to-morrow&rsquo;s work before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff smiled assent. Every one moved towards the bar, and
      conversation became general. Morris was the centre of the company, and he
      directed the talk jokingly to the account in the &ldquo;Tribune,&rdquo; making fun, as
      it seemed to me, though I did not understand all his allusions, of the
      editor&rsquo;s timidity and pretentiousness. Morris interested and amused me
      even more than he amused the others; he talked like a man of some
      intelligence and reading, and listening to him I grew light-hearted and
      careless, perhaps more careless than usual, for my spirits had been
      ice-bound in the earlier gloom of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately our County and State authorities can be fully trusted,&rdquo; some
      one said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark that &lsquo;fortunately&rsquo;, Sheriff,&rdquo; laughed Morris. &ldquo;The editor was afraid
      to mention you alone, so he hitched the State on with you to lighten the
      load.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; chimed in another of the gamblers, &ldquo;and the &lsquo;aid and succour of each
      and every citizen,&rsquo; eh, Sheriff, as if you&rsquo;d take the whole town with you.
      I guess two or three&rsquo;ll be enough fer Williams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This annoyed me. It appeared to me that Williams had addressed a personal
      challenge to the Sheriff, and I thought that Johnson should so consider
      it. Without waiting for the Sheriff to answer, whether in protest or
      acquiescence, I broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two or three would be cowardly. One should go, and one only.&rdquo; At once I
      felt rather than saw the Sheriff free himself from the group of men; the
      next moment he stood opposite to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he asked sharply, holding me with keen eye and out-thrust
      chin&mdash;repressed passion in voice and look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The antagonism of his bearing excited and angered me not a little. I
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be cowardly to take two or three against a single man. I
      said one should go, and I say so still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d go alone, wouldn&rsquo;t you? to bring
      Williams in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were paid for it I should,&rdquo; was my heedless retort. As I spoke his
      face grew white with such passion that I instinctively put up my hands to
      defend myself, thinking he was about to attack me. The involuntary
      movement may have seemed boyish to him, for thought came into his eyes,
      and his face relaxed; moving away he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set up drinks, boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They grouped themselves about him and drank, leaving me isolated. But
      this, now my blood was up, only added to the exasperation I felt at his
      contemptuous treatment, and accordingly I walked to the bar, and as the
      only unoccupied place was by Johnson&rsquo;s side I went there and said,
      speaking as coolly as I could:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though no one asks me to drink I guess I&rsquo;ll take some whisky, bar-keeper,
      if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnson was standing with his back to me, but when I spoke he looked
      round, and I saw, or thought I saw, a sort of curiosity in his gaze. I met
      his eye defiantly. He turned to the others and said, in his ordinary, slow
      way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall, good night, boys; I&rsquo;ve got to go. It&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; late, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve had
      about as much as I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether he alluded to the drink or to my impertinence I was unable to
      divine. Without adding a word he left the room amid a chorus of &ldquo;Good
      night, Sheriff!&rdquo; With him went Martin and half-a-dozen more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I had come out of the matter fairly well until I spoke to some
      of the men standing near. They answered me, it is true, but in
      monosyllables, and evidently with unwillingness. In silence I finished my
      whisky, feeling that every one was against me for some inexplicable cause.
      I resented this and stayed on. In a quarter of an hour the rest of the
      crowd had departed, with the exception of Morris and a few of the same
      kidney.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I noticed that these gamblers, outlaws by public opinion, held away
      from me, I became indignant. Addressing myself to Morris, I asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me, sir, for you seem to be an educated man, what I have
      said or done to make you all shun me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; he answered indifferently. &ldquo;You took a hand in a game where
      you weren&rsquo;t wanted. And you tried to come in without ever having paid the
      <i>ante</i>, which is not allowed in any game&mdash;at least not in any
      game played about here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The allusion seemed plain; I was not only a stranger, but a foreigner;
      that must be my offence. With a &ldquo;Good night, sir; good night, barkeeper!&rdquo;
       I left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I went as usual to the office. I may have been seated
      there about an hour&mdash;it was almost eight o&rsquo;clock&mdash;when I heard a
      knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; I said, swinging round in the American chair, to find myself
      face to face with Sheriff Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sheriff, come in!&rdquo; I exclaimed cheerfully, for I was relieved at
      seeing him, and so realized more clearly than ever that the unpleasantness
      of the previous evening had left in me a certain uneasiness. I was eager
      to show that the incident had no importance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take a seat? and you&rsquo;ll have a cigar?&mdash;these are not bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;No, I guess I won&rsquo;t sit nor smoke jest
      now.&rdquo; After a pause, he added, &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re studyin&rsquo;; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;re busy
      to-day; I won&rsquo;t disturb you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t disturb me, Sheriff,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;As for studying, there&rsquo;s not
      much in it. I seem to prefer dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; he said, letting his eyes range round the walls furnished with Law
      Reports bound in yellow calf, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I guess there&rsquo;s a big lot of
      readin&rsquo; to do before a man gets through with all those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;the more I read the more clearly I see that law is only
      a sermon on various texts supplied by common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; he went on slowly, coming a pace or two nearer and speaking with
      increased seriousness, &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ve got all Locock&rsquo;s business to see
      after: his clients to talk to; letters to answer, and all that; and when
      he&rsquo;s on the drunk I guess he don&rsquo;t do much. I won&rsquo;t worry you any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t worry me,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not had a letter to answer in three
      days, and not a soul comes here to talk about business or anything else. I
      sit and dream, and wish I had something to do out there in the sunshine.
      Your work is better than reading words, words&mdash;nothing but words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t busy; hain&rsquo;t got anything to do here that might keep you?
      Nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing. I&rsquo;m sick of Blackstone and all Commentaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I felt his hand on my shoulder (moving half round in the chair, I
      had for the moment turned sideways to him), and his voice was surprisingly
      hard and quick:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I swear you in as a Deputy-Sheriff of the United States, and of this
      State of Kansas; and I charge you to bring in and deliver at the Sheriff&rsquo;s
      house, in this county of Elwood, Tom Williams, alive or dead, and&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      your fee, five dollars and twenty-five cents!&rdquo; and he laid the money on
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the singular speech was half ended I had swung round facing him,
      with a fairly accurate understanding of what he meant But the moment for
      decision had come with such sharp abruptness, that I still did not realize
      my position, though I replied defiantly as if accepting the charge:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not got a weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys allowed you mightn&rsquo;t hev, and so I brought some along. You ken
      suit your hand.&rdquo; While speaking he produced two or three revolvers of
      different sizes, and laid them before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazed by the rapid progress of the plot, indignant, too, at the trick
      played upon me, I took up the nearest revolver and looked at it almost
      without seeing it. The Sheriff seemed to take my gaze for that of an
      expert&rsquo;s curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shoots true,&rdquo; he said meditatively, &ldquo;plumb true; but it&rsquo;s too small to
      drop a man. I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t stop any one with grit in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My anger would not allow me to consider his advice; I thrust the weapon in
      my pocket:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a buggy. How am I to get to Osawotamie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s hitched up outside. You ken hev it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rising to my feet I said: &ldquo;Then we can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had nearly reached the door of the office, when the Sheriff stopped,
      turned his back upon the door, and looking straight into my eyes said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play foolish. You&rsquo;ve no call to go. Ef you&rsquo;re busy, ef you&rsquo;ve got
      letters to write, anythin&rsquo; to do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell the boys you sed so, and
      that&rsquo;ll be all; that&rsquo;ll let you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half-humorously, as it seemed to me, he added: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re young and a
      tenderfoot. You&rsquo;d better stick to what you&rsquo;ve begun upon. That&rsquo;s the way
      to do somethin&rsquo;.&mdash;I often think it&rsquo;s the work chooses us, and we&rsquo;ve
      just got to get down and do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you I had nothing to do,&rdquo; I retorted angrily; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
      truth. Perhaps&rdquo; (sarcastically) &ldquo;this work chooses me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff moved away from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the street I stopped for a moment in utter wonder. At that
      hour in the morning Washington Street was usually deserted, but now it
      seemed as if half the men in the town had taken up places round the
      entrance to Locock&rsquo;s office stairs. Some sat on barrels or boxes tipped up
      against the shop-front (the next store was kept by a German, who sold
      fruit and eatables); others stood about in groups or singly; a few were
      seated on the edge of the side-walk, with their feet in the dust of the
      street. Right before me and most conspicuous was the gigantic figure of
      Martin. He was sitting on a small barrel in front of the Sheriff&rsquo;s buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; I said in the air, but no one answered me. Mastering my
      irritation, I went forward to undo the hitching-strap, but Martin,
      divining my intention, rose and loosened the buckle. As I reached him, he
      spoke in a low whisper, keeping his back turned to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoot off a joke quick. The boys&rsquo;ll let up on you then. It&rsquo;ll be all
      right. Say something for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rough sympathy did me good, relaxed the tightness round my heart; the
      resentment natural to one entrapped left me, and some of my
      self-confidence returned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never felt less like joking in my life, Martin, and humour can&rsquo;t be
      produced to order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fastened up the hitching-strap, while I gathered the reins together and
      got into the buggy. When I was fairly seated he stepped to the side of the
      open vehicle, and, holding out his hand, said, &ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; adding, as our
      hands clasped, &ldquo;Wade in, young un; wade in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, Martin. Good day, Sheriff. Good day, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise there came a chorus of answering &ldquo;Good days!&rdquo; as I drove up
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hundred yards I went, and then wheeled to the right past the post
      office, and so on for a quarter of a mile, till I reached the descent from
      the higher ground, on which the town was built, to the river. There, on my
      left, on the verge of the slope, stood the Sheriffs house in a lot by
      itself, with the long, low jail attached to it. Down the hill I went, and
      across the bridge and out into the open country. I drove rapidly for about
      five miles&mdash;more than halfway to Osawotamie&mdash;and then I pulled
      up, in order to think quietly and make up my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grasped the situation now in all its details. Courage was the one virtue
      which these men understood, the only one upon which they prided
      themselves. I, a stranger, a &ldquo;tenderfoot,&rdquo; had questioned the courage of
      the boldest among them, and this mission was their answer to my insolence.
      The &ldquo;boys&rdquo; had planned the plot; Johnson was not to blame; clearly he
      wanted to let me out of it; he would have been satisfied there in the
      office if I had said that I was busy; he did not like to put his work on
      any one else. And yet he must profit by my going. Were I killed, the whole
      country would rise against Williams; whereas if I shot Williams, the
      Sheriff would be relieved of the task. I wondered whether the fact of his
      having married made any difference to the Sheriff. Possibly&mdash;and yet
      it was not the Sheriff; it was the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; who had insisted on giving me
      the lesson. Public opinion was dead against me. &ldquo;I had come into a game
      where I was not wanted, and I had never even paid the <i>ante</i>&rdquo;&mdash;that
      was Morris&rsquo;s phrase. Of course it was all clear now. I had never given any
      proof of courage, as most likely all the rest had at some time or other.
      That was the <i>ante</i> Morris meant....
    </p>
    <p>
      My wilfulness had got me into the scrape; I had only myself to thank. Not
      alone the Sheriff but Martin would have saved me had I profited by the
      door of escape which he had tried to open for me. Neither of them wished
      to push the malice to the point of making me assume the Sheriff&rsquo;s risk,
      and Martin at least, and probably the Sheriff also, had taken my quick,
      half-unconscious words and acts as evidence of reckless determination. If
      I intended to live in the West I must go through with the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what nonsense it all was! Why should I chuck away my life in the
      attempt to bring a desperate ruffian to justice? And who could say that
      Williams was a ruffian? It was plain that his quarrel with the Sheriff was
      one of old date and purely personal He had &ldquo;stopped&rdquo; Judge Shannon in
      order to bring about a duel with the Sheriff. Why should I fight the
      Sheriff&rsquo;s duels? Justice, indeed! justice had nothing to do with this
      affair; I did not even know which man was in the right. Reason led
      directly to the conclusion that I had better turn the horse&rsquo;s head
      northwards, drive as fast and as far as I could, and take the train as
      soon as possible out of the country. But while I recognized that this was
      the only sensible decision, I felt that I could not carry it into action.
      To run away was impossible; my cheeks burned with shame at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was I to give my life for a stupid practical joke? &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;&mdash;a voice
      within me answered sharply. &ldquo;It would be well if a man could always choose
      the cause for which he risks his life, but it may happen that he ought to
      throw it away for a reason that seems inadequate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ought I to do?&rdquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on to Osawotamie, arrest Williams, and bring him into Kiota,&rdquo; replied
      my other self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he won&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoot him&mdash;you are charged to deliver him &lsquo;alive or dead&rsquo; at the
      Sheriff&rsquo;s house. No more thinking, drive straight ahead and act as if you
      were a representative of the law and Williams a criminal. It has to be
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The resolution excited me, I picked up the reins and proceeded. At the
      next section-line I turned to the right, and ten or fifteen minutes later
      saw Osawotamie in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew up, laid the reins on the dashboard, and examined the revolver. It
      was a small four-shooter, with a large bore. To make sure of its
      efficiency I took out a cartridge; it was quite new. While weighing it in
      my hand, the Sheriff&rsquo;s words recurred to me, &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t stop any one
      with grit in him.&rdquo; What did he mean? I didn&rsquo;t want to think, so I put the
      cartridge in again, cocked and replaced the pistol in my right-side jacket
      pocket, and drove on. Osawotamie consisted of a single street of
      straggling frame-buildings. After passing half-a-dozen of them I saw, on
      the right, one which looked to me like a saloon. It was evidently a
      stopping-place. There were several hitching-posts, and the house boasted
      instead of a door two green Venetian blinds put upon rollers&mdash;the
      usual sign of a drinking-saloon in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got out of the buggy slowly and carefully, so as not to shift the
      position of the revolver, and after hitching up the horse, entered the
      saloon. Coming out of the glare of the sunshine I could hardly see in the
      darkened room. In a moment or two my eyes grew accustomed to the dim
      light, and I went over to the bar, which was on my left. The bar-keeper
      was sitting down; his head and shoulders alone were visible; I asked him
      for a lemon squash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anythin&rsquo; in it?&rdquo; he replied, without lifting his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m thirsty and hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed that was about the figger,&rdquo; he remarked, getting up leisurely
      and beginning to mix the drink with his back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used the opportunity to look round the room. Three steps from me stood a
      tall man, lazily leaning with his right arm on the bar, his fingers
      touching a half-filled glass. He seemed to be gazing past me into the
      void, and thus allowed me to take note of his appearance. In
      shirt-sleeves, like the bar-keeper, he had a belt on in which were two
      large revolvers with white ivory handles. His face was prepossessing, with
      large but not irregular features, bronzed fair skin, hazel eyes, and long
      brown moustache. He looked strong and was lithe of form, as if he had not
      done much hard bodily work. There was no one else in the room except a man
      who appeared to be sleeping at a table in the far corner with his head
      pillowed on his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I completed this hasty scrutiny of the room and its inmates, the
      bar-keeper gave me my squash, and I drank eagerly. The excitement had made
      me thirsty, for I knew that the crisis must be at hand, but I experienced
      no other sensation save that my heart was thumping and my throat was dry.
      Yawning as a sign of indifference (I had resolved to be as deliberate as
      the Sheriff) I put my hand in my pocket on the revolver. I felt that I
      could draw it out at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      I addressed the bar-keeper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, do you know the folk here in Osawotamie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a pause he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most on &lsquo;em, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another pause and a second question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Tom Williams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes looked at me with a faint light of surprise in them; they looked
      away again, and came back with short, half suspicious, half curious
      glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re a friend of his&rsquo;n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him, but I&rsquo;d like to meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, though?&rdquo; Turning half round, the bar-keeper took down a bottle
      and glass, and poured out some whisky, seemingly for his own consumption.
      Then: &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s not hard to meet, isn&rsquo;t Williams, ef you and me mean
      the same man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we do,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;Tom Williams is the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said the tall man who was leaning on the bar near me, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the Williams that stopped Judge Shannon yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name,&rdquo; came the careless reply, &ldquo;but I stopped a man in
      a buck-board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plucking out my revolver, and pointing it low down on his breast, I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sent to arrest you; you must come with me to Kiota.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without changing his easy posture, or a muscle of his face, he asked in
      the same quiet voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean, anyway? Who sent you to arrest me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheriff Johnson,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man started upright, and said, as if amazed, in a quick, loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheriff Johnson sent <i>you</i> to arrest me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;Sheriff Samuel Johnson swore me in this morning as his
      deputy, and charged me to bring you into Kiota.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a tone of utter astonishment he repeated my words, &ldquo;Sheriff Samuel
      Johnson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Samuel Johnson, Sheriff of Elwood County.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he asked suddenly, fixing me with a look of angry suspicion,
      &ldquo;what sort of a man is he? What does he figger like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little shorter than I am,&rdquo; I replied curtly, &ldquo;with a brown beard
      and bluish eyes&mdash;a square-built sort of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; There was savage rage and menace in the exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You kin put that up!&rdquo; he added, absorbed once more in thought. I paid no
      attention to this; I was not going to put the revolver away at his
      bidding. Presently he asked in his ordinary voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What age man might this Johnson be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About forty or forty-five, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And right off Sam Johnson swore you in and sent you to bring me into
      Kiota&mdash;an&rsquo; him Sheriff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied impatiently, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, bringing his clenched right hand heavily down
      on the bar. &ldquo;Here, Zeke!&rdquo; turning to the man asleep in the corner, and
      again he shouted &ldquo;Zeke!&rdquo; Then, with a rapid change of manner, and speaking
      irritably, he said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that thing up, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bar-keeper now spoke too: &ldquo;I guess when Tom sez you kin put it up, you
      kin. You hain&rsquo;t got no use fur it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The changes of Williams&rsquo; tone from wonder to wrath and then to quick
      resolution showed me that the doubt in him had been laid, and that I had
      but little to do with the decision at which he had arrived, whatever that
      decision might be. I understood, too, enough of the Western spirit to know
      that he would take no unfair advantage of me. I therefore uncocked the
      revolver and put it back into my pocket. In the meantime Zeke had got up
      from his resting-place in the corner and had made his way sleepily to the
      bar. He had taken more to drink than was good for him, though he was not
      now really drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me and Zeke a glass, Joe,&rdquo; said Williams; &ldquo;and this gentleman, too,
      if he&rsquo;ll drink with me, and take one yourself with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the bar-keeper sullenly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not drink to any damned
      foolishness. An&rsquo; Zeke won&rsquo;t neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he will,&rdquo; Williams returned persuasively, &ldquo;and so&rsquo;ll you, Joe.
      You aren&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; back on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll be just damned if I am,&rdquo; said the barkeeper, half-conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you take, sir?&rdquo; Williams asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bar-keeper knows my figger,&rdquo; I answered, half-jestingly, not yet
      understanding the situation, but convinced that it was turning out better
      than I had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Zeke?&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old pizen,&rdquo; Zeke replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Joe, whisky for you and me&mdash;the square bottle,&rdquo; he
      continued, with brisk cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence the bar-keeper placed the drinks before us. As soon as the
      glasses were empty Williams spoke again, putting out his hand to Zeke at
      the same time:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, old man, so long, but saddle up in two hours. Ef I don&rsquo;t come
      then, you kin clear; but I guess I&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Tom,&rdquo; replied the bar-keeper, taking the proffered hand, still
      half-unwillingly, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re stuck on it; but the game is to wait for &lsquo;em
      here&mdash;anyway that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d play it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A laugh and shake of the head and Williams addressed me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir, I&rsquo;m ready if you are.&rdquo; We were walking towards the door, when
      Zeke broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Tom, ain&rsquo;t I to come along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Zeke, I&rsquo;ll play this hand alone,&rdquo; replied Williams, and two minutes
      later he and I were seated in the buggy, driving towards Kiota.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had gone more than a mile before he spoke again. He began very quietly,
      as if confiding his thoughts to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make no mistake about this business&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t worth
      while. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right, and Sheriff Samuel Johnson sent you, but,
      maybe, ef you was to think you could kinder bring him before me. There
      might be two of the name, the age, the looks&mdash;though it ain&rsquo;t
      likely.&rdquo; Then, as if a sudden inspiration moved him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did he come from, this Sam Johnson, do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he came from Pleasant Hill, Missouri. I&rsquo;ve heard that he left
      after a row with his partner, and it seems to me that his partner&rsquo;s name
      was Williams. But that you ought to know better than I do. By-the-bye,
      there is one sign by which Sheriff Johnson can always be recognized; he
      has lost the little finger of his left hand. They say he caught Williams&rsquo; 
      bowie with that hand and shot him with the right. But why he had to leave
      Missouri I don&rsquo;t know, if Williams drew first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied now,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;but I guess you hain&rsquo;t got that
      story correct; maybe you don&rsquo;t know the cause of it nor how it began;
      maybe Williams didn&rsquo;t draw fust; maybe he was in the right all the way
      through; maybe&mdash;but thar!&mdash;the first hand don&rsquo;t decide
      everythin&rsquo;. Your Sheriffs the man&mdash;that&rsquo;s enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this no word was spoken for miles. As we drew near the bridge
      leading into the town of Kiota I remarked half-a-dozen men standing about.
      Generally the place was deserted, so the fact astonished me a little. But
      I said nothing. We had scarcely passed over half the length of the bridge,
      however, when I saw that there were quite twenty men lounging around the
      Kiota end of it. Before I had time to explain the matter to myself,
      Williams spoke: &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s got out all the vigilantes;&rdquo; and then
      bitterly: &ldquo;The boys in old Mizzouri wouldn&rsquo;t believe this ef I told it on
      him, the dog-goned mean cuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We crossed the bridge at a walk (it was forbidden to drive faster over the
      rickety structure), and toiled up the hill through the bystanders, who did
      not seem to see us, though I knew several of them. When we turned to the
      right to reach the gate of the Sheriff&rsquo;s house, there were groups of men
      on both sides. No one moved from his place; here and there, indeed, one of
      them went on whittling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew up at the sidewalk, threw down the reins, and jumped out of the
      buggy to hitch up the horse. My task was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the hitching-rein loose in my hand, when I became conscious of
      something unusual behind me. I looked round&mdash;it was the stillness
      that foreruns the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Williams was standing on the side-walk facing the low wooden fence, a
      revolver in each hand, but both pointing negligently to the ground; the
      Sheriff had just come down the steps of his house; in his hands also were
      revolvers; his deputy, Jarvis, was behind him on the stoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Williams spoke first:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam Johnson, you sent for me, and I&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff answered firmly, &ldquo;I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their hands went up, and crack! crack! crack! in quick succession, three
      or four or five reports&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how many. At the first shots
      the Sheriff fell forward on his face. Williams started to run along the
      side-walk; the groups of men at the corner, through whom he must pass,
      closed together; then came another report, and at the same moment he
      stopped, turned slowly half round, and sank down in a heap like an empty
      sack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried to him; he had fallen almost as a tailor sits, but his head was
      between his knees. I lifted it gently; blood was oozing from a hole in the
      forehead. The men were about me; I heard them say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A derned good shot! Took him in the back of the head. Jarvis kin shoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose to my feet. Jarvis was standing inside the fence supported by some
      one; blood was welling from his bared left shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t much hurt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I guess the Sheriff&rsquo;s got it bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men moved on, drawing me with them, through the gate to where the
      Sheriff lay. Martin turned him over on his back. They opened his shirt,
      and there on the broad chest were two little blue marks, each in the
      centre of a small mound of pink flesh.
